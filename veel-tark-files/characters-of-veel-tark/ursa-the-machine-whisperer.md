**STORY**

Little is known about Ursa's past before becoming a Machine Whisperer: she graduated with honors in the engineering branch of the alchemist's guild and soon earned a reputation as one of the brightest minds in creating complex machines. Over time, she directed all development and manufacturing operations and found herself lost in creating her machines for hours. The rest of her past is a mystery, although different rumors point to a dark history.

She was said to have always shown an excessive passion for machines and technology, to the point of overshadowing her interest in people. It seems that she has a hard time understanding the emotions and needs of others and often feels frustrated and uncomfortable in social situations.

Despite her apparent coldness, those who come to know her deeply say that Ursa can be an affable and generous woman, albeit somewhat distant. However, her mysterious past continues to loom over her, and overall, she comes across as dry and curt with others.
