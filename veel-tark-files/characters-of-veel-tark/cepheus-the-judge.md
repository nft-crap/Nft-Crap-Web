**STORY**

Cepheus has been a procurator in the city of Veel-Tark for over half a century. Despite his advanced age, he remains one of the most respected and admired judges in the city.

Cepheus' concern has always been the state of justice in Veel-Tark. He has seen how laws and precedents have changed over the years, often favoring the powerful and marginalizing the poor and disadvantaged. Cepheus decided that something had to be done to restore justice and equity to the city.

He began studying the ancient laws and precedents, many of which had been forgotten or ignored by modern judges. Cepheus became an expert in these laws, and began applying them in his trials, often surprising his colleagues and earning the admiration of the citizens of Veel-Tark.

Today, Cepheus is known as the judge of the old laws, and is famous for his wisdom and sense of justice. He is an advocate for the poor and marginalized, and has worked tirelessly to protect the rights of all citizens of Veel-Tark, regardless of their status or wealth.
