**STORY**

The Gatekeeper of Veel-Tark is a sentinel of the spectral race, known for his great wisdom, serenity, elegant form, and magnetic presence. As the keeper of the gateway to the city, he has been tasked with ensuring the safety and protection of Veel-Tark from any threats that may come from the outside world.

Born into a long line of Guardians, he was trained in the art of spectral magic from a young age, honing his abilities to manipulate the fabric of reality itself. With his mastery of this magic, he is able to create powerful wards that keep Veel-Tark safe from harm.

Though he is often seen as reserved and aloof, the Gatekeeper cares deeply for the people of Veel-Tark and works tirelessly to maintain the harmony and balance of the city. His presence alone is often enough to ward off any would-be attackers, but when danger does arise, he is a fearsome opponent.

Many rumors and legends have grown up around the Gatekeeper, but one thing is certain: he is a steadfast protector and a symbol of hope and security for the people of Veel-Tark.
