**STORY**

Lyra, an exegete from the branch of chroniclers, is Master of the Council of Sages in Veel-Tark. Born to a humanite father and a cyanite mother, Lyra had to face difficult moments due to her mixed-race condition. Although the city is known for its respect for different races, there are still some sectors of the population that distrust those who do not belong to a single race.

But her great intellect prevailed, and Lyra was chosen to serve on the Council of Exegetes of the city, where she reached the rank of Master. From this position, Lyra dedicated herself to promoting dialogue and mutual understanding among the different races and guilds in the city. Over time, her work and her example began to bear fruit, and people began to more openly accept population diversity.

Lyra also became a passionate advocate for the rights of mestizos in Veel-Tark. She fought for equal opportunities and an end to discrimination, and worked to promote understanding and mutual respect among the city's races.

Despite her success and recognition on the Council of Exegetes, Lyra always maintained her humility and dedication to her work. For her, the pursuit of knowledge and the promotion of justice are fundamental values that should never be compromised.
