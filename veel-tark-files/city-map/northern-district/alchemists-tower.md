Although, technically, it has the layout of a tower, forming a cylindrical structure, its interior, with a gigantic perimeter and an imposing height, accommodates numerous rooms and chambers where the Alchemists tirelessly research. With one wing for the Hancrafters/artisans and another for the Engineers, the Alchemists' Tower also has colossal cellars, the mines, where the Moles work. From these cellars, a labyrinthine network of underground corridors connects the tower to the Mint to facilitate the traffic of assets and cryptocurrency mined in the mines, linking one district to the other.
