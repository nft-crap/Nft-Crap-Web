In reality, it is not a single building, but a complex of buildings dedicated to the divine scarab, including study halls, a prayer centre, an offering hall, etc. The temple is where the Hierophants and Thaumaturges work their wonders, and their passage is more restricted than in other buildings in Veel-Tark.
