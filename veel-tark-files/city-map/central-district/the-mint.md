The Mint is one of the main buildings that faces the Agora Square. It is where some of the trustees work, such as the Treasurers. It is, in essence, Veel-Tark's bank and treasury chamber. In the basement are amassed the assets and cryptocurrencies that are mined in the Alchemists' Chamber, a building to which the Mint connects through a long network of tunnels.
