The Veel-Tark library is a titanic endeavour to build the most monumental library that has ever existed, attempting to bring together every letter, every idea and every text that civilisation has ever created. In a way, this building, whose architecture resembles that of the Library of Alexandria, seems to emulate the space of the Akashic Records themselves with their innumerable archives. Papyrus, sheets, scrolls, codices, volumes and all kinds of written documents rest within its walls. It is also the study place of the Chroniclers, with a section of ancient texts for the Logographers and another of contemporary texts for the Narratables.
