A majestic legal and ministerial building. It is where both legal and administrative matters are settled, so that in the Prytaneum you can find Jurists, Councillors and Nuncios. The entire legal and juridical network passes through its departments, where large meeting rooms, in which assemblies are usually held, and numerous offices are accumulated. It is the natural home of the Legal Rabbits.
