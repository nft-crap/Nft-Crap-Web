The Sentinels are responsible for ensuring the smooth running of every corner of Veel-Tark, preventing disturbances and ensuring that the thirteen values are observed in the behaviour of the citizens. They are moderators, custodians and peacemakers.

### Seraphs&#x20;

**Seraphs** are sentinels of the highest rank, and have access to all Veel-Tark premises where it is appropriate to establish standards of behaviour and vigilance. They are the stewards of order.

### Archangels

**Archangels** are lower grade sentries, with more restricted access than their companions the seraphs. They are in charge of places with higher traffic and more open access to other guilds. They are more like moderators.
