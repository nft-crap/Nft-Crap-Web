### Hermetic Society of the Seven Principles

This Faction takes as the starting point of its occult interests the Hermetic teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, and especially the seven principles developed in The Kybalion. It is, of all the factions, the one most closely aligned with esoteric principles; its members see themselves as guardians of knowledge which must be unravelled by the initiate through lifelong study and practice of the seven principles.
