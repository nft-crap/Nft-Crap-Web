### The Venus Tablet Study Circle&#x20;

It focuses on cosmic events, with a pseudo-scientific character that takes some concepts from quantum physics, such as multiverses or brane cosmology, and combines them with esoteric beliefs about otherworldly entities, different planes of existence or astrological derivatives. Its name comes from the Venus Tablet, a 7th century BC text that reproduces another Babylonian text written some 1,700 years BC, in which extraordinary astronomical observations are recorded.

**Development Field**: Framework.
