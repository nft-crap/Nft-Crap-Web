### A World Of Secret Societies

We are talking about a time of great advances. It is a nascent world, immersed in the genesis of this new age which, by definition, also produces a state of chaos and great social inequalities.

It is a world for all, but dominated by elites, in which the privileged seek to centralise power through information.

The great crusade of the secret societies will consist, then, in decentralising knowledge; in making it, through their work, available to all. To unveil the universe of magical and mysterious objects, of very powerful sources of knowledge. Objects that represent keys to doors. Doors that lead to other worlds, to other realities.
