### The Search For The Agora

With the technological and social upheaval of the last third of the 19th century, and in the wake of names such as Helena Blavatsky, Allan Kardec, Henry Olcott, August Le Plongeon and James Churchward, a wave of occultists began to become aware of the control that the privileged were trying to exert over the new cultural advances. Thus, from the work of personalities such as Rudolf Steiner, Guido Von Lizt, Aleister Crowley, William Wynn Westcott, Theodor Reuss or Annie Besant, doctrines such as Anthroposophy, Ariosophy or Thelema were born, and secret societies such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Ordo Templi Orientis, the Thule Society, etc. developed. In principle, a fraternal and supportive spirit prevails, full of good intentions.

It is from this approach that the first attempt was made to bring together the knowledge and research of all these new associations into a meeting place where all paths of wisdom converge and all truths meet.&#x20;
