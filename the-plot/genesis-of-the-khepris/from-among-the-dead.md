It was rumored that not only the aforementioned allegorical sculpture was saved from the fire on New Year's Eve 1922, but also that gear machinery whose movement never ceased. Steiner managed to save it and put it in a safe place in an unknown location. However, after his death, and with time, the legend spread that the mechanical contraption had been buried somewhere in the necropolis of Tuna el-Yebel (Hermopolis Magna of the New Empire of Ancient Egypt), near the Tomb of Petosiris, in whose catacombs there is a sober representation of Osiris-Khepri in bas-relief form.
