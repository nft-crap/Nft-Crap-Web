### **Encounter with the solar beetle**

In the last years of his life, Rudolf Steiner, founding father of the city of Veel-Tark, began to give some relevance to the figure of Khepri, an Egyptian deity who, in the form of a dung beetle pushing the solar disk, represents creation and rebirth, the constant transformation of existence. The importance that this figure took on for Steiner can be related to a recurring need to reinvent himself, considering that his fascination with Khepri concurred with the zenith of a life of changes and searches for truth: from Theosophy to Anthroposophy; from Anthroposophy to the School of Spiritual Science, the latter as a project that he left in the air two years after his death (Christmas, 1923).

It also coincided with the fire at the Goetheanum building (New Year's Eve 1922), the headquarters of anthroposophy and a world cultural reference, from which only an allegorical sculpture depicting the spiritual forces that move the world was saved. For Steiner, this fire again pointed to the need to rebuild his project through transformation.
