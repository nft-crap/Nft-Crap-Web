### **The fragment of the **_**Codex Hermopolitanus**_

But a little-known fact is fundamental to this story: between the years 1918 and 1920, at an undetermined date, a strange manuscript falls into the hands of Holberins, signed by a certain G. W. Athanasius, a mysterious German hermeneutic of whom very little is known. It is possible that Athanasius was a disciple of Wilhelm Dilthey, the famous philosopher, historian, sociologist, psychologist, and, like Athanasius himself, a hermeneutic whose approaches to spiritual sciences and worldviews greatly influenced scientific and spiritual thought in the early 20th century. Similarly, Athanasius's syncretic philosophy, bridging modern science, esotericism, and mythology, had many points of convergence with the founding father of Veel-Tark.

In any case, this text, supposedly part of an unknown Codex Hermopolitanus, delves into the figure of Khepri as the constructor of the universe and suggests the design of a cosmic engine based on a machinery of gears, whose activity stems from the mathematics of chaos and quantum mechanics that Henri Poincar√© and Max Planck had begun to develop in the first two decades of the 20th century. All of this must have been revelatory for Holberins. Therefore, it is necessary to include Athanasius's manuscript in this story...
