### **The fragment of the **_**Codex Hermopolitanus**_

But a little-known fact is fundamental to this story: between 1920 and 1922, at an undetermined date, a strange manuscript fell into Steiner's hands, signed by a certain G. W. Athanasius, a mysterious German hermeneut about whom very little is known. It is possible that Athanasius was a disciple of Wilhelm Dilthey, the famous philosopher, historian, sociologist, psychologist and, like Athanasius himself, hermeneut, and whose approaches to the spiritual sciences and worldviews had a powerful influence on Rudolf Steiner's thinking. Similarly, Athanasius' syncretic philosophy, between modern science, esotericism and mythology, had many points of convergence with the founding father of Veel-Tark.

In any case, this text, supposedly part of an unknown _Codex Hermopolitanus_, deepens in the figure of Khepri as the builder of the universe and suggests the design of a cosmic engine based on a geared machinery, whose activity starts from the mathematics of chaos and quantum mechanics that Henri Poincar√© and Max Planck had begun to develop in the first two decades of the twentieth century. All this must have been revealing for Steiner. It is necessary, therefore, to include the Athanasius manuscript in this story...
